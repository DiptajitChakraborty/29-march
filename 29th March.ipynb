    "Ans: Ridge regression is a regression technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that addresses some of its limitations.Ridge regression introduces a regularization term to the OLS objective function in order to reduce the impact of multicollinearity. The regularization term is a penalty that shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero. This penalty term is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter or lambda (λ). As λ increases, the impact of the penalty increases, resulting in more shrinkage of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    " The main difference between ridge regression and ordinary least squares regression is the addition of the regularization term. By introducing the penalty term, ridge regression trades off some of the unbiasedness of the OLS estimates for reduced variance. This can lead to improved prediction performance when dealing with multicollinear data."

Ridge regression will then estimate the coefficients for each variable, considering both the continuous and encoded categorical variables."
